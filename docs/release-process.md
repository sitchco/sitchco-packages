# Release Process

Follow these steps to create a new release of the project.

## 1. Ensure All Changes Are Merged

- Push all final changes to the `master` branch.
- Make sure your local branch is up to date with `master`:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

## 2. Prepare the Release Locally

Run the following commands:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm changeset
```
* Follow the prompts from changeset to describe the changes.
* Commit the generated changeset file(s).

Then bump the version of each package:

```bash
pnpm version
```

This will:

* Update package.json versions.
* Generate changelogs based on the changesets.

## 3. Push Version Updates to Master

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Release: version bump and changelogs"
git push origin master
```

## 4. Create a GitHub Release
* Go to the Releases page.
* Click "Draft a new release".
* Choose the latest tag (auto-generated by pnpm version).
* Fill in the title and changelog (can reuse content from the generated changelog).
* Click "Publish release."
* This will trigger a GitHub Action that automatically publishes the packages to the npm registry.
